## Streamlit app for Credit Card Fraud Detection

- Using a previously developed data pipeline (published as a [Python Package](https://pypi.org/project/tid-credit-card-fraud-prediction/) to predict whether a transaction is a Fraud or Not Fraud based on the transactions' characteristics. For more details, please refer to the [Github repository of the data pipeline](https://github.com/hfung4/credit_card_fraud_detection/tree/main/credit_card_fraud_production).
- This web-app will accquire credit card transaction data from the user and use the trained pipeline to make Fraud predictions (Not Fraud, Fraud).
